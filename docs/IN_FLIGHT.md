# In flight

**Start at `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN_2026_09_26.md` §0.** It holds the current item ("Now"), the session checklist, the
decisions and the order. This file only says who is working and what rules apply between sessions; it carries no status
of its own (plan rule 0b.16).

- **One session owns the whole repository** (since 2026-09-29; the user stopped every other session). The two-session
  handshake that lived here is retired; its text is in git history at `caf0cf71f`.
- **The compiler rebuild lands on `main`** slice by slice (D18): each slice is gated by `bazel test //...` and `bazel test
  //tools/deps:all` on the exact tree, then pushed with `git push origin HEAD:compiler/rebuild HEAD:main`.
- **Paused while the rebuild runs:** `docs/SERVER_PROGRAM_2026_09_26.md` (its legs are SV0–SV3, not the rebuild's W0–W7),
  the DataCube feature programs (`docs/DATACUBE_*`), NLQ (the untracked `nlq/` directory is not ours; leave it).

## A second line, 2026-09-29: DataCube against the warehouse (the user's ask, rule 5)

In the worktree `legend-lite-dcsnap`, branch `datacube-live-snap`. **Owns:** `datacube/`. **Touches `warehouse/`** (one
line each, announced here before landing):
- `server/Identity.java`, `server/WarehouseServer.java`: `POST /sql/v1/token/refresh` (a valid token for a fresh one,
  never past the sign-in's session limit, 12h default); tokens carry their sign-in time (`principal|expiry|signedInAt`);
  `--token-key-file` (a key kept across restarts), `--token-minutes`, `--session-hours`; `Config.sessionLimit`.
- `server/Statements.java` (+ `Identity.hasUser`): a GRANT must name an object (or schema) that exists and a
  grantee (or role member) who is a user or role; REVOKE stays open. Test:
  `WarehouseEntitlementsTest.aGrantNamesSomethingThatIsThereForSomeoneWhoIs`.
- `sqlapi/SqlApiBinding.java`, `sqlapi/NativeBinding.java`: `refresh(token)`. Tests: `IdentityTest` (new),
  `WarehouseServerTest.aValidTokenRefreshesAndTheFreshOneWorks`.

**Touches CI** (`.github/workflows/gates-run.yml`, `gate.yml`): a `browser` lane, Linux only --
`//datacube:live_snap_test` and the `browser-ci` harnesses; the other lanes unchanged. `docs/GATES.md`: its row.

Nothing in `core/`, `spec/`, `tools/`. Runs a warehouse (`:9090`) and the DataCube site (`:8000`), idle: stop them before
a timing (rule 4).

## A third line, 2026-09-30: DataCube track A and the BI plan (the user's ask, rule 5)

`docs/BI_AND_ETL_PLAN_2026_09_29.md`; the user: "start track A now, and go in the suggested order for everything that does
not need any server side work". **Owns:** `datacube/` (and its CI lane). No edit in `core/`, `spec/`, `tools/` or
`warehouse/`; the plan's server-side items (F1 write, F2's resolver, F4, F5, unpivot) wait for the rebuild's say (§8).

**2026-10-01, announced before landing (rule 5): a cross-area edit in `core/`** (the user: "announce it and do
it"). So a file opened in DataCube's tab has its model written WITHOUT the WebAssembly module, on any planner (legend-engine
included), and the writer cannot drift from the compiler's:
- STRUCTURED, no type string parsed (the user: "do the homework first of how to do this CORRECTLY in structured form"):
  `DuckDb.CATALOG_COLUMNS_SQL` reads a table's columns from `duckdb_columns()` joined on the type id to
  `duckdb_types()` -- each column's canonical type, and a DECIMAL's precision and scale as numbers. `catalogType` is
  data over that (`CATALOG_TYPES`, `CATALOG_ALIASES` for JSON, `CATALOG_REFUSED` with reasons); the regexes are gone.
  `CatalogModel.Column` CHANGED: `(name, dataType, logicalType, precision, scale)`. `CatalogModelTest` reads real
  DuckDB tables, and a completeness test fails on a canonical type with no decision.
- Callers moved with it: `wasm/.../Wasm.java` `databaseFromCatalogOrError` takes the structured column; the warehouse's
  `/sql/v1/catalogs/{c}/objects` adds `logicalType`, `precision`, `scale` to each column (`type` kept).
- `datacube/tools/catalogfacts/` generates `datacube/src/generated/catalog-facts.ts` (the tables and the catalog
  question) and `datacube/test/generated/catalog-corpus.ts` (what `CatalogModel.database` answers for real DuckDB
  tables); `datacube/src/catalog-model.ts` is DataCube's writer, tested against the corpus case for case.
  `WasmPlanner.databaseFromCatalog` is kept (its input is now the structured column); DataCube no longer calls it.

**2026-10-01, announced before landing (rule 5): a cross-area edit in `core/`** (the user: "i think we should fix calc
column"). legend-engine refused 13 DataCube features that legend-lite passes; one cause is legend-lite's own leniency:
- `core/.../compiler/spec/Typer.java` `collection`: a literal of more than one value requires each element to be exactly
  `[1]`, as legend-engine (`ValueSpecificationBuilder.visit(Collection)`) and legend-pure (`InstanceValueValidator`) do.
  `$x.notional * 1.1` over a nullable column is then refused, as on engine (write `->toOne()`). This reverts the
  2026-09-11 loosening (`MULTIPLICITY_AUDIT_2026_08_20.md` §4a), whose premise "real pure accepts it" legend-pure's
  source contradicts; `MultiplicityStrictnessTest` flips back to expecting the refusal.
- NOT changed in `core/` (the user: engine's gaps are compensated in DataCube and recorded, not "fixed" in legend-lite):
  `over(String[*], SortInfo[*], Frame[0..1])` (in engine's over.pure, never registered by its Handlers.java) and BIT
  typed Boolean (engine's RelationalCompilerExtension says TinyInt; legend-pure says Boolean). Both get register rows.

**2026-10-01, announced before landing (rule 5): a cross-area edit in `core/`** (the user: "do them"). A column DuckDB's
catalog says is NOT NULL is declared `NOT NULL` in the written Database, so legend-lite and legend-engine type it `[1]`
and `$x.n * 1.1` compiles over it without `->toOne()`:
- `DuckDb.CATALOG_COLUMNS_SQL` reads `duckdb_columns().is_nullable`; `CatalogModel.Column` gains `notNull`; a line is
  `name TYPE NOT NULL` for such a column. Callers move with it: `Wasm.databaseFromCatalogOrError`, the warehouse's
  catalog listing (adds `notNull`), DataCube's generated writer and corpus.

## A fourth line, 2026-09-30: the Query app (the user's ask; design `docs/QUERY_APP_DESIGN_2026_09_30.md`)

**STATUS 2026-10-01: v1 LANDED on main** (the branch `query/app`, fast-forwarded after the full gate). Everything
below is on main; the line continues on the same branch -- next, upstream's look and layout, then the gaps in the
design doc's v1 status. A cross-area edit from here on is announced here first, as before.

In the worktree `legend-lite-query`, branch `query/app`. **Owns:** `query/` (new). **Touches, one line each:**
- `fixtures/saved-queries/` (new, 2026-10-01, asked by the DataCube line): saved queries exactly as
  `GET /api/pure/v1/query/{id}` answers -- explicit context, data-space context, defaultParameterValues, a graph
  fetch (not a cube source) -- made through the real API and each run on the demo model (`make.mjs`); README.md
  says how to read one. `js_library` `//fixtures/saved-queries:records`, visible to `//query` and `//datacube`:
  Query tests its reading against it (`query/test/saved-queries.test.ts`, through `persist.ts contextOf`); DataCube's
  saved-query source will test against the same files.
- `.github/workflows/gates-run.yml` (2026-10-01): the browser lane runs every `browser-ci` target in `//query` as
  well as `//datacube` -- `//query:verify` (the end-to-end steps, both planes), its server on Bazel's JDK.
- `core/src/main/java/com/legend/server/PureV1Api.java` + `LegendHttpServer.java` routes (+ `PureV1ApiTest`):
  the upstream `pure/v1` endpoints the Query app needs and lite lacks, each in legend-engine's shape, measured
  against 4.145.0 -- `execute` with `parameterValues`, `compilation/compile`, `compilation/lambdaReturnType`,
  graphFetch results, the query store. Each routes to existing lite functions; no new compiler logic.
- `core/src/main/java/com/legend/Compiler.java`: `executeWire(model, ValueSpecification, ...)` gains the graph-fetch
  branch its text twin already has (one `if`, no compiler logic) -- `execute` answers graphFetch as the engine does.
- `core/src/main/java/com/legend/server/SavedQueries.java` (new): the engine's query store, in a directory the
  server is started with (`--query-store DIR`).
- NOT on this line (2026-09-30, the user's call): `analytics/mapping/modelCoverage` and `analytics/dataSpace/render`
  are engine ANALYSES lite does not have -- new platform features, proposed for core (design doc §1, G6/G9), not
  added here. The Query app shows every property and lists a mapping's classes as the mapping declares them.
- Graph-fetch trees: ONE representation (2026-09-30, crosses parser/protocol/compiler -- announced here).
  `GraphFetchLiteral` is the tree only (class, property nodes, root subtype entries); the column-list desugaring
  it carried is gone. The parser reads a tree with its grammar only (the `IslandScan` character scanner's graph
  half is deleted; the tree re-lexes its slice at its real line/column for wire spans). `ProtocolReader` gains
  `rootGraphFetchTree` (the two print-and-parse workarounds in PureV1Api and Wasm are gone). `NameResolver` keeps
  the tree (class names resolve in place; call arguments are its children). `GraphFetchChecker`, `IsDistinctChecker`
  and lineage `ScanRelations` walk the tree; everything after the checker (`TypedGraphTree`) is unchanged.
  Graph-position argument spellings live only in `ProtocolEmitter.gftParam` and `ProtocolReader.graphArg`.
  Evidence: `//spec:corpus_duckdb` + `:corpus_h2` per-test pass/fail lists and judge ledgers identical to the
  pre-change baseline (trace ids masked); `//parser-equivalence:diagnostics`, `//core:core_tests` (4295),
  `//core:guardrails` (no pin raised), `//query:verify` green. Fixes W1.2's `graphFetchKeepsSubTypeTrees` known
  defect. Unchanged gaps, noted: a tree typed on its own still refuses (the engine's type is
  `RootGraphFetchTree<T>`); lineage does not trace inside subtype views; `prop()` vs `prop` is not on the wire.
- `wasm/src/main/java/planner/Wasm.java`: `modelJsonOrError` (E2's twin, byte-identical to the server's).
- `datacube/BUILD.bazel`: ONE line, `visibility = ["//query:__pkg__"]` on `:src` (2026-09-30), so the Query app runs
  its planned SQL on DataCube's engines (`engine.ts`, `duckdb.ts`, `warehouse.ts`). And (2026-10-01, user-approved) a
  `styles` filegroup (`src/**/*.css`, visible to `//query`): Query's results grid is a `CubeApp` over the query, so
  its page loads DataCube's stylesheets. Query uses `CubeApp`, `Planner`, `sourceColumns`,
  `RemoteRun`/`LegendEngineExecutor`, `relationColumns` as they are.
- `datacube/src` (2026-10-01, the user's ask, cleared with the DataCube line): a DataCube-owned "controls hidden" mode.
  `CubeApp` option `controlsHidden` + `setControlsHidden()`/`controlsHidden`; one root class
  (`dc-controls-hidden`, `app.css`) hides the title bar, drag zones, columns panel and status bar; the way back is the
  right-click menu's LAST entry, `view.controls` "Hide Controls"/"Show Controls" (`ui/menu.ts`; the order before it
  untouched; the user: "right click only"). View state: no query, no undo step, not saved. Tests: `menu.test.ts`,
  `app.test.ts`. Query opens its embedded cube with it.
- `datacube/src` (2026-10-01, the user's ask, cleared with the DataCube line): a DARK THEME, opt-in by the page --
  `<html data-dc-theme="dark">` (Query sets it from its own light/dark switch and the system setting). `theme.css`: the
  same tokens redefined under `:root[data-dc-theme='dark']` (palette roles kept: --tw-white the surface, --tw-black
  the ink, the neutral ramp reversed, tints dark; `color-scheme: dark`) and the chart panel's `--dc-chart-*`.
  `grid/screen-colours.ts` `onScreen`, at the grid's two paint paths only: a configured colour equal to its DEFAULT
  becomes `var(--dc-theme-*, <default>)`; a chosen colour is painted as chosen; exports never pass through it (they
  stay light). The last hard-coded colours became token references with their old value as fallback (grid.css total
  row, band, red-50 tint; app.css error ink). PROOF: 853 DataCube elements' computed colours (grid, menu, Properties)
  identical before/after in light. Tests: `screen-colours.test.ts`; `typed-values.ts` reads a cell's painted colour
  (jsdom does not resolve `var()`). Known gap: a heatmap's default low end (#ffffff) is interpolated in TS, still white.
- `MODULE.bazel`: a second `npm_translate_lock` (`npm_query`, `//query:pnpm-lock.yaml`), so `datacube/`'s lock
  is not touched.

Nothing in `datacube/`, the compiler packages, `warehouse/`.

**Found for the compiler's owners:** (1) FIXED on this line 2026-10-01 (the user: "def fix the lambda bug"):
`Compiler.resultType` on a lambda WITH parameters typed the lambda itself (`LambdaFunction<{Integer[1] -> Relation<...>}>`),
so `lambdaRelationType`/`lambdaReturnType` answered a function type where legend-engine types the result with the
parameters in scope. `SpecCompiler.typeQueryBody` now binds a lambda's declared parameters (`Typer.declaredType`, shared
with the annotated-lambda fold) and types the body; undeclared parameters stay refused. Test: `PureV1ApiTest`
`e5e6_aQueryWithParameters_typesAsItsBody`; the relational corpus (duckdb, h2) per-test lists identical with and
without the change. (2) NOT fixed here: a derived property `{$this.quantity *
$this.price}: Float[1]` (Integer * Float) compiles in lite; legend-engine refuses it ("'Number' is not a subtype of
'Float'").

**2026-10-01, the DataCube line: several sources on a page, and the source picker** (the user: "New is fine; Picker
should offer everything"). In `datacube/` (the Query line also edits it; ping before landing either way):
`src/app.ts`, `src/ui/menu.ts` (Insert becomes **New ▸ Source… / Grid / Chart**), `src/page/cube-page.ts` (a grid over
another source), `src/planner.ts` + `src/wasm-planner.ts` (`withModel`: a planner over another model sharing the same
worker or server), a new `src/ui/source-picker.ts` and `src/saved-queries.ts` (upstream `/pure/v1/query`, read only),
`demo/boot.ts` (the Data window becomes the picker). Nothing in `core/`.

**2026-10-01, the DataCube line: a saved query as a source** (the user: "lets work on saved queries now"). One line in
`query/`: `query/BUILD.bazel` exports `demo/models/*` to `//datacube` (read only), so DataCube's site serves the trading
project a saved query compiles against -- the same files, not a copy that could drift. In `datacube/`: `src/saved-queries.ts`,
`src/planner.ts`, `src/wasm-planner.ts`, `src/pure-v1.ts`, `src/planner-worker.ts` (`ModelOptions`: a mapping, read as
`->from(mapping, runtime)` outermost as Query runs it; the model's enumerations; `modelElements`), `src/relation-type.ts`,
`demo/boot.ts`, `demo/page-config.ts`, `demo/config.json`. Reads `fixtures/saved-queries/`, writes nothing there.

**2026-10-01, the DataCube and Query lines: one query store, in a package of its own** (the user: "the right
architecture", "i really do want the private browser sharing mode with no server", "a share link that encodes everything
you need about a Saved Query"). A new top-level package `query-store/`: upstream's `Query` records, ONE typed client
(`QueryStoreClient`, read-only `QueryReader` for DataCube) over a `fetch`, and an IN-PAGE server -- upstream's
`/api/pure/v1/query` answered from IndexedDB, ported from legend-lite's `SavedQueries.java` -- that the client is handed
in place of the network when no server is configured. One wire-level suite runs against both: the in-page server and
legend-lite (`//core:server`, `--query-store`). And a saved query's share link (`#q1.`). **Moves out of `query/`**:
`src/backend/local-store.ts` and the `Query` types of `src/backend/wire.ts` (re-exported there); `HttpEngine`'s store
calls go through the client; `query/BUILD.bazel`, `query/tsconfig.json`, `query/demo/main.ts`. In `datacube/`:
`src/saved-queries.ts` loses its own client. Then one site serving both apps from one origin, so the browser store is
shared. Nothing in `core/`.

## A fourth line, 2026-10-03: one owner for every database decision (the user's ask, rule 5)

`docs/PLAN_EXECUTION_SPLIT_AND_DATABASE_OWNER_2026_10_03.md` (homework done; its §4 the steps). The user: "make sure
there is really only one owner and one single place through the whole code that makes this decision". **This line
does ONLY B1 and C3** of that plan; everything that lives in the rebuild's areas is handed to the execution plan (see
below), not done here.

**Announced cross-area edits (each lands with the full chain):**
- B1, the guards: `core/BUILD.bazel` (`//core:guardrails` also loads `:duckdb_load`, so `exec/DuckDbAppenderLoad` is
  checked), `core/src/test/java/com/legend/ArchitectureTest.java` (`CORE_PROD_CLASSES` = exactly the product: test
  support `com.legend.testing..`/`com.legend.tools..` out; F1.3b's text says it measures JDBC API use).
- C3, the database registry: a new `com.legend.database` (one entry per `DatabaseType`, data and plan-side objects
  only, no `java.sql`), and its consumers, edited only where they decide by database: `Compiler.dialectFor` /
  `executesOn`; `StatementExecutor`'s engine-text renderer selection (`toSQLString`, `planDialect`, `H2_DDL`,
  `ENGINE_TEXT`) and `PlanAllocations`; `plan/InProtocol`; `SqlTextVerdicts`; `exec/SystemDatabase`;
  `exec/JdbcMetadata`; `server/ConnectionResolver`; `test/StorelessRuntime`; `sql/dialect/AnsiSqlRenderer` and its
  subclasses (the `jdbcProduct` constructor argument leaves); `DialectBoundaryTest`; `tools/deps/core-layers.txt`.
  C3a landed 2026-10-03: `//core:database` (`core/BUILD.bazel`, `tools/deps/BUILD.bazel`), `PlanEnvelope`,
  `ArchitectureTest`'s library map, and the `dialectFor` callers `wasm/.../Wasm.java` and
  `datacube/tools/catalogfacts/CatalogFacts.java` (now `Databases.dialect`).

**Handed to the rebuild (not touched here):** the effect scan's swallowed compile errors (`StatementExecutor
.containsEffect`; D10's demand-driven rule), the `ExecutionContext` reader's `"H2"` defaults (`ContextReading`), the
missing platform functions (W2.1 / W4.4a, decision D9), the plan/execution split (W6.2's first cut) — each with its
measurements in the plan document above.

## A fifth line, 2026-10-03: Studio, SDLC-lite and Depot-lite (the user's ask, rule 5)

Design `docs/STUDIO_DESIGN_2026_10_02.md` (every decision ruled); census `studio/docs/UPSTREAM_STUDIO_CENSUS.md`. The
user: "write the depot and lite projects/versions/model home as part of studio so we have a real writer of models";
"i paused compiler rewrite so we can do (2) here". **Owns:** `studio/` (the app), the SDLC-lite and Depot-lite servers
(their module named when it lands), and the S18 dogfood model.

**The compiler rebuild is paused by the user** while this line builds the core pieces Studio needs (design S11), each
announced here with its files before it lands, every push through the full chain:
- (a) name-resolved entity JSON per element (the protocol layer and `NameResolver`'s rules);
- (b) W1.2 by its written design (`plan-audit-2026-09-26/h4-diagnostics-design-2026-09-29.md`): parser codes, spans
  and UTF-16 columns first, then the diagnostics sink and stage bridges; moved to the execution plan's §3 when it lands;
- (c) a WASM compile entry (`wasm/`);
- (e) the model JSON reader and (f) the model printer (`jsonToGrammar/model`), for opening existing upstream projects
  (design S19).

Not touched: the stress corpus and the Bazel hermeticity work (another session's; the design takes the stress corpus
last, S17).

## Rules between sessions

1. Never force-push; never bare `git stash` (the stash stack is shared by every worktree).
2. Before pushing, `git fetch origin`; `main` must fast-forward.
3. The gate chain is `bazel test //...` then `bazel test //tools/deps:all`; `//parser-equivalence:diagnostics` runs only on
   its triggers (a pin bump, a parser/lexer/protocol change, a corpus manifest change).
4. A timing is a lane run alone with `--nocache_test_results`, load under 3 at the start, nothing else building.
5. If a second line of work starts again, this file becomes the handshake again: each side's owned area, cross-area edits
   announced one line each before they land, and dated status lines.
